## Project Overview
`payroll_xml_extractor` is a Python utility designed to parse and extract payroll information from XML files following the SAT (Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria) standards in Mexico. It supports multiple CFDI versions and converts payroll data into SQL insert statements, facilitating database integration.

## Features
- Supports CFDI versions '3' and '4'.
- Parses employer details, employee positions, payment dates, and deductions from XML files.
- Generates SQL insert statements for database integration.
- Batch processes XML files in a specified directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- xml.etree.ElementTree module (included in standard Python distribution)

## Installation
No special installation is required. Just ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Getting Started
Before using `payroll_xml_extractor`, ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
To run the project, execute the `main.py` script from the root directory. Ensure that your XML files are placed in the `xml_input` directory.
```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
- src/:
  - xml_parser.py: Contains the core functions for parsing the XML files. It includes functions for extracting namespaces, processing individual XML files, and compiling the data into SQL insert statements.
- xml_input/:
  - Place your XML files in this directory. These files will be processed by the script.
- main.py:
  - The entry point for the application. It calls the functions defined in xml_parser.py to process the XML files.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for file processing and XML parsing issues. Errors are logged to the console with detailed messages to aid in troubleshooting.

## Limitations
- Tailored for XML files conforming to specific SAT CFDI versions.
- Outputs SQL insert statements to the console; modification may be needed for database integration.

## Notes
- Ensure that the XML files are correctly formatted and adhere to the expected structure for successful parsing.
- The script currently prints the SQL insert statements to the console. Modify the main.py file if you need to redirect this output to a file or a database.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:

- Ensure the XML files are in the correct format and version.
- Verify that the file paths in the script are correct.

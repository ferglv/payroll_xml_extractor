## Project Overview
`payroll_xml_extractor` is a Python utility designed to parse and extract payroll information from XML files following the SAT (Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria) standards in Mexico. It supports multiple CFDI versions and converts payroll data into SQL insert statements, facilitating database integration.

## Features
- Supports CFDI versions '3' and '4'.
- Parses employer details, employee positions, payment dates, and deductions from XML files.
- Generates SQL insert statements for database integration.
- Batch processes XML files in a specified directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- xml.etree.ElementTree module (included in standard Python distribution)

## Installation
No special installation is required. Just ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Getting Started
Before using `payroll_xml_extractor`, ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Place your XML files in a directory (e.g., `./xml_input`).
2. Modify the `directory_path` variable in the script to point to your directory of XML files.
3. Run the script using Python.

```python
directory_path = './xml_input'
parsed_data = process_all_xmls(directory_path)
```

## Functionality
- `get_namespace(root)`: Extracts the CFDI namespace from the XML root.
- `parse_xml(file_path)`: Parses an individual XML file, extracting payroll information and formatting it into an SQL insert statement.
- `process_all_xmls(directory)`: Processes all XML files in a given directory.

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for file processing and XML parsing issues. Errors are logged to the console with detailed messages to aid in troubleshooting.

## Limitations
- Tailored for XML files conforming to specific SAT CFDI versions.
- Outputs SQL insert statements to the console; modification may be needed for database integration.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check the following:

- Ensure the XML files are in the correct format and version.
- Verify that the file paths in the script are correct.
